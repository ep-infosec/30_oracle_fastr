## Normally this file exports JAVA_HOME and JVM related variables.
## Unlike GNU-R, for which JVM is not essential, we assume that JAVA_HOME is already exported and we just define the remaining JVM related variables.
## It is not clear if this is necessary/useful for FastR at all,
## since any package that embeds JVM is bound to fail on FastR anyway,
## maybe it can be useful for packages that depend on rJava to, e.g., compile their Java sources.
