# Function Calls

### RCallNode AST schema

RCallNode represents and executes the syntax node for a function call.
	
#### default dispatch (RFunction)
	
	// Dispatches a call to a function for actual arguments

### Function Fast-Paths Infrastructure

The RRootNode class, which is the base class for FunctionDefinitionNode and RBuiltinRootNode, provides 
an optional facility for an optimised execution of its AST. The optimisation is centered
around the FastPathFactory interface, whose instance may be retrieved from an RRootNode using
the getFastPath method returning an instance of FastPathFactory or null, if the root node
does not support the fast path.

In terms of execution, the FastPathFactory#create() method is called by DispatchedCallNode
to obtain an instance of RFastPathNode. This node is then used in DispatchedCallNode#execute
to execute the fast path first. If the fast path execution fails, which is indicated by returning null,
the execution defaults to the original path.

Currently, the optimisation using FastPathFactory takes place in two classes: ArgumentMatcher
and CallMatcherCachedNode.

#### ArgumentMatcher

ArgumentMatcher, which is responsible for matching actual call argument nodes with the formal
arguments of a function, is able to perform two optimisations based on the information provided by FastPathFactory:
argument inlining and forced promise evaluation. The gist of both optimisations is that
the argument node is evaluated on the caller site. Otherwise, the AST of the called function would
aggregate AST trees of promises from various callers, which would lead to the swelling of the function's code 
(see PromiseHelperNode#generateValueDefault and InlineCacheNode). Furthermore, the argument promise could also be evaluated 
at more places in the function. Ideally, reading an argument in a function body
should be as simple as reading a value from the frame, which would be the case if the argument is evaluated
on the caller site. On the contrary, reading a value from a non-optimised promise leads to iterating an inline cache (InlineCacheNode)
caching promise ASTs from various callers to find the AST of the current caller and evaluating it.

##### Argument inlining
As long as the FastPathFactory declares that a given argument is always evaluated by the function,
then it safe to conclude that it is safe to evaluate the argument eagerly. In uch a case,
the argument node will be evaluated on the caller site and no argument promise will be created, i.e.
no promise node will be created either.

By default, builtins declare to evaluate all arguments. If some argument of a builtin is not evaluated, it is declared 
by adding its index to the nonEvalArgs attribute of the RBuiltin annotation.
On the other hand, non-builtin functions do not evaluate the arguments (see EvaluatedArgumentsFastPath) by default.
The default behavior can be overridden using RRootNode.setFastPath, as is done in BasePackage.loadOverrides,
where fast paths of several functions are overridden.

##### Forced promise evaluation

Unless an argument is evaluated, its argument node is wrapped up into a promise wrapper node,
which will be evaluated to obtain a promise for the argument. This promise is then passed to
the function call. Also in this case it is possible, under certain circumstances, to create
an optimised promise (OptForcedEagerPromiseNode), which eagerly evaluates the argument value
on the caller site. This scenario is carried out when FastPathFactory#forcedEagerPromise(argIndex)
returns true for a given argument index. See PromiseNode.create.

As to builtins, by default, the forcedEagerPromise method return false for all arguments. There are
exceptions to this rule, such as builtins cbind and rbind, which override the default behavior
by setting the FastPathFactory.FORCED_EAGER_ARGS fast path factory in BasePackage#loadOverrides.

As to non-functions, a special analysis of the body of a function is carried out in the constructor of
FunctionDefinitionNode to determine which argument can be evaluated on the caller site. To be qualified for that, an argument must be
read in any execution path of the function body and be "simple" (see EvaluatedArgumentsVisitor.isSimpleArgument).
For more details go to EvaluatedArgumentsVisitor.

### Incrementing/Decrementing Reference Count in Arguments

Before the value returned by an argument node is passed to a function call it may be subject to
incrementing its reference count. It is done by WrapArgumentNode after the argument value is evaluated
by the wrapped original argument node. The WrapArgumentNode uses the ArgumentStatePush node
to increment the ref count. ArgumentStatePush also registers a request for the later decrementing of the ref count,
which is done in the finally block of the function's execute method (i.e. FunctionDefinitionNode.execute).
The decrementing procedure and the register of the arguments, whose refcounts are to be decremented,
are encapsulated in PostProcessArgumentsNode, a child node of FunctionDefinitionNode. PostProcessArgumentsNode is created
by RASTBuilder and passed to the FunctionDefinitionNode constructor.

	// created for each "wrappable" argument node when creating CallArgumentsNode
	WrapArgumentNode
		// the original arg node
		RNode
		// increments the ref count of a shareable argument and registers the request for decrementing
		ArgumentStatePush



### `CALLER_FRAME` argument life-cycle 
(see `CallerFrameClosureProvider`)

	Legend:
	(*)     - a caller frame closure holding a materialised frame; it never occurs in the interpreter
	( )     - a caller frame closure with no frame; it never occurs in the compiler
	*       - a materialised closure
	^       - a request for the frame, e.g. stack introspection
	<opt>   - optimisation; the boundary between interpreted and compiled code
	<deopt> - deoptimisation; the boundary between compiled and interpreted code
